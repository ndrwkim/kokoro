v2: "latter days" probably refers to the time of the Messiah

v4:
>He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.

Not quite there yet unfortunately. But all people long for freedom from war, then wthe nations seek to follow the "ways" of "the God of Jacob".

v5:
>O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord.

v11:
>The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, and the lofty pride of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.

v12:
>For the Lord of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up--and it shall be brought low;

v17:
>And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the lofty pride of men shall be brought low, and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.

haughtiness - the appearance or quality of being arrogantly superior and disdainful
lofty - of imposing height; of a noble or exalted nature; proud, aloof, or self-important

Be humble. The Lord alone will be exalted.

v22:
>Stop regarding man in whose nostril is breath, for of what account is he?

Human power and pride are weak.
