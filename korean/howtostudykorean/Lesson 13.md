### Korean Particles: 과/와, 랑/이랑 and 하고

과/와, 랑/이랑, 하고 can all be used interchangeably to mean “and” or "with".
- 나는 사과와 바나나를 샀어 = I bought apples and bananas
- 나는 친구와 갔어 = I went with my friend

Two adverbs that are commonly used in sentences with “with” are 같이 and 함께. Both of them mean “together,” and can be used in sentences even if the sentence doesn’t have one of the particles meaning “with” (과/와/랑/이랑/하고).
- 우리는 음악을 같이 들었어요 = We listened to music together
- 우리는 음악을 함께 들었어요 = We listened to music together

“와/과” is more likely to be used in writing and in formal situations, whereas “(이)랑” is more likely to be used is speech. Likewise, the use of “함께” is generally used in writing and formal situations. Therefore, the use of 함께 is more likely to be paired with 과/와 in these cases.

==Use 랑/이랑 and 같이 in speech==

"I built a house with my hands" uses a different "with".
“my hands” are the method by which you did something, so, as you learned in [[Lesson 12]], (으)로 should be used in those situations.
- 저는 손으로 집을 지었어요

### Korean Particles: 에게, 한테, 께

These three particles can all be used to indicate that you are doing (usually giving) something TO somebody. 에게, 한테 and 께 all have the same meaning, but 한테 is usually used in conversation, 에게 is usually written (although it is still said in conversation very often) and 께 is used when the person you are giving something to requires respect (께 is the honorific form of 에게/한테).
- 아버지는 아들에게 돈을 준다 = The father gives money to his son
- 나는 학생들한테 한국어를 가르쳤어 = I taught Korean to the students
- 저는 부장님께 그 사실을 말할 거예요 = I will tell that (fact) to my boss
	- A more common way of saying this will be introduced in [[Lesson 39]]

==Use 한테 in speech==

Note that just because you use 께 doesn’t mean that your sentence needs to end in a polite way. 께 is used when the person who is being given to is of high importance, regardless of who you are talking to. If I were a teacher talking to my student, talking about something being given TO the principal, I could say:
- 나는 책을 교장선생님께 줬어 = I gave the principal a book

### Korean Particles: 에게서, 한테서, (으)로부터

You learned in [[Lesson 12]] that 에서 can be used to mean “from” in a wide variety of situations. 에게서/한테서 can also have the translation of “from,” but they are used in a more restricted way.

에게서/한테서 has the meaning that is opposite of 에게/한테/께, which means it is used when somebody receives something from somebody. These particles are attached to the person from whom one receives something.
- 나는 나의 여자친구에게서 편지를 받았어 = I received a letter from my girlfriend

The “thing” that is being received doesn’t need to be something physical. It could be something abstract like stories, explanations, or other things.
- 저는 그것을 친구한테서 들었어요 = I heard that from my friend

A very similar particle is (으)로부터. This particle can also be attached to the person from whom one receives something.
- 나는 나의 여자친구로부터 편지를 받았어 = I received a letter from my girlfriend

(으)로부터 can also be used when receiving something from a non-person thing (a company/the government/etc). But you cannot use 에게서/한테서 to indicate that you received something from a non-person.

==Use 한테서 in speech==

### Do something for somebody: 을/를 위해(서)

If you want to say that you are doing something FOR (the benefit of) somebody, you can add 를/을 to the person who you are doing something for, followed by 위해(서):
- 나는 나의 여자 친구를 위해(서) 꽃을 샀어 = I bought flowers for my girlfriend
- 나는 부장님을 위해(서) 이것을 썼어 = I wrote this for my boss
- 저는 친구를 위해 빵을 만들었어요 = I made bread for my friend
- 아버지를 위해 시원한 물을 준비했어요 = I prepared cool water for my father

No difference between 위해 and 위해서.

This form is usually used when you are doing something for a person, but can also be used sometimes when you are doing something for a non-person:
- 저는 회사를 위해 열심히 일할 거예요 = I will work hard for the company

The important thing is that the thing for which you are doing something must be a noun. You can use 위해 to indicate that you are doing something for the purpose of a verb (I am going there to/for the purpose of see(ing) a movie) but you will learn about that in [[Lesson 32]] once you have learned how to change verbs into nouns.

를/을 위해 means for the benefit of. "I am waiting for the bus" – the ‘bus’ is the object which you are waiting for, so you attach the particle 을/를 to ‘bus’ but not 을/를 위해:
- 나는 버스를 기다린다

### About something 에 대해

에 대해 can also be attached to nouns like 를/을 위해, but this has the meaning of “about.”
- 나는 너에 대해 생각했어 = I thought about you
- 나는 나의 아버지에 대해 말했어 = I spoke about my father
- 나는 그것에 대해 책을 쓸 거야 = I will write a book about it
- 그 회계사는 정부에 대해 나쁜 말을 했어요 = That accountant said bad things about the government

Just like with 을/를 위해서, there is very little (if any) difference between 에 대해 and 에 대해서.

You cannot use 에 대해 in the following sentence: "My favorite thing about you is your eyes." See [[Lesson 28]].
